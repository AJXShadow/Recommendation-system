# Job Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at building a **Job Recommendation System**. By leveraging job descriptions and user skills, the system identifies and ranks job postings that best match a user's profile. The project uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to measure the relevance of job postings based on textual data.

## Features
- **Data Processing and Cleaning**:
  - Handles missing values to ensure clean data for analysis.
  - Focuses on critical features like job titles and descriptions.
- **Textual Analysis**:
  - Implements TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into meaningful numerical representations.
- **Job Matching**:
  - Uses cosine similarity to recommend jobs that align with the user's skills and preferences.
- **Visualization**:
  - Employs Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful data visualizations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a sample dataset named `dice_com-job_us_sample.csv`, which includes various job postings. Key features of the dataset include:
- Job Title
- Job Description
- Skills
- Company Information

## Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/job-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd job-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Vectorize text data.
   - Compute job recommendations based on user input.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating user feedback loops to improve recommendations.
- Expanding the system to include personalized filters like location and salary.
- Deploying the system as a web application for broader accessibility.
